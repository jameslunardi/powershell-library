# PowerShell Library

A comprehensive collection of enterprise-grade PowerShell scripts and automation solutions developed for real-world production environments. This repository showcases practical automation tools across Active Directory management, DevOps operations, Azure administration, and security tooling.

## Disclaimer

**Important:** These solutions were originally developed for specific enterprise environments and are provided as-is for educational and reference purposes.

- **Original Development:** Created without AI assistance for production use in enterprise environments
- **AI Enhancement:** Scripts have been sanitised and documented with AI assistance for professional presentation (August 2025)
- **Testing Status:** Enhanced scripts have NOT been tested post-processing
- **Use at Own Risk:** Test thoroughly in your environment before any production use
- **Impact Warning:** These tools interact with production systems, modify configurations, and handle sensitive data
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure appropriate permissions, backups, security measures, and compliance procedures
- **Professional Validation:** Strongly recommended before any production implementation

The author assumes no responsibility for any data loss, security issues, or operational problems resulting from the use of this code. Professional testing and validation are essential.

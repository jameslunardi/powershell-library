## General Requirements

- **PowerShell 5.1+** (PowerShell 7+ recommended)
- **Administrative privileges** for security log access
- **Appropriate security clearances** and permissions
- **Secure storage** for exported data and reports

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data Handling** - Security logs contain PII and access patterns
- **Access Control** - Restrict tool usage to authorized security personnel
- **Data Retention** - Implement appropriate retention policies for security data
- **Audit Trails** - Maintain logs of security tool usage and data access
- **Compliance** - Ensure tools meet regulatory and organizational requirements

## Use Cases

### Security Monitoring
- Daily user activity analysis
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Insider threat monitoring
- Access pattern analysis

### Compliance Auditing
- User access reviews
- Privileged account monitoring
- Regulatory compliance reporting
- Audit trail generation

### Incident Response

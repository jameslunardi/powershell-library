## Overview

This script addresses a critical challenge in hybrid environments: tracking user activity across cloud-only SaaS applications to maintain accurate user lifecycle management and optimize license costs.

### Business Problem Solved

**Challenge:** Users accessing only Azure AD-authenticated SaaS services (Office 365, Teams, SharePoint Online, etc.) don't generate on-premises logon events, leading to:
- Unnecessary account disabling due to perceived inactivity
- Poor visibility into actual user engagement with cloud services
- Inefficient license allocation decisions
- Compliance challenges with user access reviews

**Solution:** Intelligent synchronization of Azure AD sign-in activity to on-premises Active Directory via ExtensionAttribute9, enabling:
- Activity-aware account lifecycle management
- Hybrid identity governance with complete visibility
- Integration with existing on-premises processes
- Automated license optimization workflows

# Export certificate for Azure AD app registration
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "AzureADActivitySync.cer"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ClientId` | String | Yes | N/A | Azure AD application (client) ID |
| `TenantId` | String | Yes | N/A | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `CertificateThumbprint` | String | Yes | N/A | Certificate thumbprint for authentication |
| `ActivityThresholdDays` | Int | No | 60 | Days to consider for recent activity |
| `LogPath` | String | No | Script directory | Path for log file |
| `ReportOnly` | Switch | No | False | Run without making AD changes |
| `TestMode` | Switch | No | False | Process only subset of users |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Activity Sync
```powershell
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" -TenantId "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321" -CertificateThumbprint "ABC123DEF456..."
```

### Custom Activity Threshold
```powershell
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb -ActivityThresholdDays 90
```

### Report-Only Mode (Testing)
```powershell
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb -ReportOnly
```

### Test Mode (Small Dataset)
```powershell
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb -TestMode
```

### Custom Logging
```powershell
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb -LogPath "C:\Logs\AzureADSync.log"
```

## How It Works

### Activity Analysis Logic
1. **Retrieves Azure AD Users** with sign-in activity data
2. **Calculates Activity Status** based on:
   - Interactive sign-ins (user logins)
   - Non-interactive sign-ins (app/service authentications)
   - Minimum days since any sign-in activity
3. **Determines Active Status**:
   - `True`: User has signed in within threshold days
   - `False`: User hasn't signed in within threshold OR never signed in

### AD Integration Process
1. **Matches Users** by converting UPN to SamAccountName
2. **Checks Current Value** of ExtensionAttribute9
3. **Updates Only When Needed** to minimize AD operations
4. **Logs All Actions** for audit and troubleshooting

### Attribute Mapping
- **ExtensionAttribute9 = "True"**: User active within threshold
- **ExtensionAttribute9 = "False"**: User inactive or never signed in

## Integration Examples

### Daily Scheduled Sync
```powershell
# Task Scheduler configuration
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File C:\Scripts\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId '$clientId' -TenantId '$tenantId' -CertificateThumbprint '$certThumb'"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "02:00AM"
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Azure AD Activity Sync" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
```

### License Management Integration
```powershell
# Run sync before license management processes
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb

# Azure AD Connect sync to push changes to Azure AD
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta

# Dynamic group will automatically update based on ExtensionAttribute9
```

### Account Lifecycle Integration
```powershell
# Enhanced account disabling process
.\Sync-AzureADActivity.ps1 -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb

# Account disabling script now checks both:
# - LastLogonDate (on-premises activity)
# - ExtensionAttribute9 (cloud activity)
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
```powershell
# Check sync results and alert on issues
$logContent = Get-Content "C:\Scripts\AzureADSync.log" -Tail 50
$errors = $logContent | Where-Object { $_ -like "*ERROR*" }

if ($errors) {
    Send-MailMessage -To "admin@company.com" -Subject "Azure AD Sync Errors" -Body ($errors -join "`n")
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Schedule During Off-Hours** to minimize Graph API throttling
2. **Use Test Mode First** for large environments (10,000+ users)
3. **Monitor Log File Size** and implement rotation for long-term operation
4. **Consider Batching** for very large tenants

### Expected Performance
| User Count | Processing Time | Memory Usage | Recommendations |
|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| < 1,000    | 2-5 minutes    | < 100 MB     | Standard operation |
| 1K-5K      | 5-15 minutes   | 100-300 MB   | Monitor during business hours |
| 5K-10K     | 15-30 minutes  | 300-500 MB   | Schedule off-hours |
| 10K+       | 30+ minutes    | 500+ MB      | Consider batching approach |

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```powershell
# Verify certificate installation
Get-ChildItem -Path "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" | Where-Object Thumbprint -eq $CertificateThumbprint

# Test Graph connection
Connect-MgGraph -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $certThumb
Get-MgContext
```

### Permission Problems
```powershell
# Check Graph permissions
$context = Get-MgContext
$context.Scopes

# Test user data access
Get-MgUser -Top 1 -Property SignInActivity
```

### Active Directory Issues
```powershell
# Test AD connectivity
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Get-ADDomain

# Test attribute updates
Set-ADUser -Identity "testuser" -Replace @{ExtensionAttribute9 = "TestValue"}
Get-ADUser -Identity "testuser" -Properties ExtensionAttribute9
```

### Azure AD Connect Sync
```powershell
# Verify ExtensionAttribute9 is synchronized
Get-ADSyncConnectorPartition
Get-ADSyncGlobalSettings

# Force sync after updates
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Certificate Security**: Store certificates securely, use appropriate access controls
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for compliance requirements
- **Least Privilege**: Use minimum required permissions for Graph API access
- **Data Retention**: Configure log retention according to organizational policy

### Operational Security
- **Service Account**: Use dedicated service account with minimal required permissions
- **Network Security**: Ensure secure communication channels for Graph API calls
- **Change Management**: Test thoroughly in non-production before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Implement alerting for authentication failures or processing errors
